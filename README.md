## Gramfort's Approach - taken from class notebook

The idea is based on the following references:

- William S. Cleveland: "Robust locally weighted regression and smoothing
scatterplots", Journal of the American Statistical Association, December 1979,
volume 74, number 368, pp. 829-836.

- William S. Cleveland and Susan J. Devlin: "Locally weighted regression: An
approach to regression analysis by local fitting", Journal of the American
Statistical Association, September 1988, volume 83, number 403, pp. 596-610.

The main idea is to perform a local linear regression in a neighborhood of k observations close by and then apply an iteration to rescale the weights based on the residuals; this step is argued to yield a more robust model.

Below is Gramfort's Approach:

    Lowess smoother: Robust locally weighted regression.
    The lowess function fits a nonparametric regression curve to a scatterplot.
    The arrays x and y contain an equal number of elements; each pair
    (x[i], y[i]) defines a data point in the scatterplot. The function returns
    the estimated (smooth) values of y.
    The smoothing span is given by f. A larger value for f will result in a
    smoother curve. The number of robustifying iterations is given by iter. The
    function will run faster with a smaller number of iterations.

## Adapt and modify the code for Gramfortâ€™s version of Lowess to accommodate train and test sets with multidimensional features.
